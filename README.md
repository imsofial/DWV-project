# Lung Cancer Visualization Project

## Project Overview

Lung cancer is a significant global health concern. Early detection and awareness play a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project aims to create six interactive visualizations to analyze the relationship between lung cancer symptoms, age, and gender.

By providing a clear understanding of how lung cancer manifests across demographic groups, we hope to raise awareness and encourage early testing. The visualizations will help answer critical questions such as:

- How do lung cancer symptoms vary across different age groups?
- What patterns can be identified in lung cancer symptoms across all ages?
- What are the main symptoms leading to lung cancer?

## Dataset

We use an external dataset from Kaggle, which provides detailed information on lung cancer symptoms across different age groups and genders.

**Dataset Details:**

- **Demographics:** Gender (M/F), Age (30-80)
- **Symptoms & Risk Factors:** Smoking, alcohol consumption, peer pressure, chronic disease, allergies, anxiety, fatigue, yellow fingers
- **Lung Cancer Presence:** YES/NO
- **Dataset Size:** 3,000 patients (51% diagnosed with lung cancer)
